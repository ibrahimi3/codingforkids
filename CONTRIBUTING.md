### Help With PRs and Git

* Q: I need to change something in my branch after I submitted a PR. Can I?
  * A: Yes, you can add more commits to your branch and the PR will be updated with them. Please add a comment to the PR to explain what you added.

* Q: I was asked to rebase my PR. What do I do?
  * A: Changes were made to master or other PRs were merged in and your PR is no longer based on the latest code and likely has conflicts. You can update your fork, then replay your changes onto the latest version so that merging your PR will be possible.
